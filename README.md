<h2>Installation</h2>
    
**Setup**

In order to run our app locally, you will need to have already installed Yarn and Rails. Check them with:

    $ yarn -v
    $ rails -v
    
If no version number is returned, please install <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> and/or <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> before continuing.

**Dependencies**

You'll also need to install all dependencies of the project with:

    $ bundle install
    $ yarn install
    
The bundle command installs all Ruby Gems specified in our Gemfile. The yarn install command retrieves all dependencies from the project’s package.json file.


**Run the following command to create a database, load the schema, and initialize it with our seed data.**

    $ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

**API Keys**

Lastly, our API keys are hidden. You will need to touch a .env file and populate it with your own Mapbox and Cloudinary API keys.

*Include your .env file in the .gitignore*

**Launch** 💪

Finally! Lets launch the app by running:

    $ rails s
    $ yarn build --watch # In another tab of the terminal
    
alternatively this shortcut the above

    $ bin/dev
    
    
Then type *localhost:3000* in your favourite browser
